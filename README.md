**Assessment and Evaluation of an Unsupervised Machine Learning Model for Automotive and Industrial NVH Applications**

**Abstract**

Rapid changes in the global industry like the emergence of electric vehicles and high-resolution data have posed new challenges for NVH engineers. Current analysis techniques involve an interdisciplinary knowledge of structural dynamics, signal processing and psychoacoustics but most notably they require experienced professionals to analyse and assess the ever-expanding amount of acquired industrial NVH data. Concurrently recent advances in machine learning show data driven model inference of feature representations- without human intervention. Unsupervised data driven methods have the potential to support NVH teams to focus on actual solutions by reducing manual efforts for pre-processing, classification and assessment of measurement and simulation-based data.
